The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

### [10. Linked list cycle](https://github.com/UCIX210/)
**Technical interview preparation:**


### [11. Hello, write](https://github.com/UCIX210/)

 * Use the function `write` from the sys module
 * You are not allowed to use `print`
 * Your script should print to `stderr`
 * Your script should exit with the status code `1`
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./100-write.py
and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ echo $?

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```


### [12. Compile](https://github.com/UCIX210/)
Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`

The output filename has to be `$PYFILEc` (ex: `export PYFILE=my_main.py` => output filename: `my_main.pyc`)
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ cat main.py 
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Best School")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYFILE=main.py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./101-compile
