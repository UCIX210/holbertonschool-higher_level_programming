## Requirements
 * Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 * All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`<a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank"> <img height="" src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Ubuntu&color=E95420&logo=Ubuntu&logoColor=E95420&labelColor=2F333A" alt="Suite CRM"></a> using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
 * A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
 * Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
 * There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
 * You are not allowed to use system

 ## Tasks
### [0. Run Python File](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`
* The output should be saved in the file `c`

```

```


### [1. Run inline](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`
* The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c.`
    * Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`

```
 
```

### [2. Hello, print](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`
* The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`
    * Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`
```
  
```

### [3. Print integer](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`
```
  
```

### [4. Print float](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
* Use the function `puts`
* You are not allowed to use `printf`
* Your program should end with the value `0`
```
 
```

### [5. Print string](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line..
* Use the function `printf`
* You are not allowed to use the function `puts`
* Your program should return `0`
* Your program should compile without warning when using the `-Wall` `gcc` option
```

```

### [6. Play with strings](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
* You should produce the exact same output as in the example
* Warnings are allowed
* Your program should return `0`
* You might have to install the package `libc6-dev-i386` on your Linux (Vagrant) to test the `-m32` `gcc` option
```

```

### [7. Copy - Cut - Paste](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)
Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
* The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.
* The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
    * Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`
```

```

### [8. Create a new sentence](https://github.com/UCIX210/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
* You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) `printf` or man (3) `puts`
* Your program should return 1
* Your program should compile without any warnings when using the `-Wall` `gcc` option
```

```
